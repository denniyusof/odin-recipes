</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Sprinkle beef sirloin strips with garlic powder. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat and sear beef strips, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a slow cooker.</li>
    <li>Mix bouillon cube with hot water in a separate container until dissolved, then mix in cornstarch until dissolved.</li>
    <li>Cover, and cook on High for 3 to 4 hours, or on Low for 6 to 8 hours.</li>
